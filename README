1. Introduction

   This is the manual for yarrow. Yarrow lets you read RGTP bulletin
   boards, such as [12]GROGGS at Cambridge University, using a web
   browser.
   
   Some other pages worth looking at: [13]screen shots, [14]contact
   information, and [15]links to other RGTP sites.
   
2. Getting started as a user

2.1. Basics

   Yarrow is most commonly used with GROGGS, so I'll use that as an
   example here. The procedure is fairly similar for any RGTP board,
   though. You'll also need a copy of yarrow to play with; if you don't
   have one locally, you can use the example one at
   [16]http://rgtp.thurman.org.uk/gossip. There's also [17]a copy running
   inside the University Data Network, but that may not always be running
   the most recent version of the program. If you want to set up a copy
   on your own computer, skip ahead to the section "Getting started as an
   administrator".
   
   Firstly, it's useful to set up a yarrow account, so that all state
   (such as whether or not you've read a particular item) can be held on
   the yarrow server. It's not necessary to set one up; if you go to
   [18]the GROGGS index without having logged in, for example, you can
   simply click the "visitor" button to read the whole of GROGGS. (You
   might like to try doing that now for a bit.) However, you'll need an
   account if you want to post, so let's set one up: click "log in" on
   the right-hand menu, and then "get a new account". Enter your email
   address, which yarrow uses to identify you, and press OK.
   
   While you're waiting for the confirmation email from the server, let's
   discuss how RGTP works. An RGTP board consists of several discussion
   threads, called items. Any user with posting access can create new
   items, or add replies to the end of an item. Items have a fixed
   maximum size, so when one gets too long, you have to start another,
   with a name more pertinent to whatever the discussion's about now
   (this helps minimise the distance between subject lines and discussion
   topics that's so common on Usenet). The system tracks when a new item
   is a continuation of an old one, so it's possible to follow a long
   discussion through-- this is known as a thread.
   
   You should have your email from the server by now. Click the "change
   your password" link, and fill in the address you used, the password
   you were given, and two copies of a new password. Once you've clicked
   OK, you'll be logged into yarrow.
   
2.2. GROGGS

   Click the "gossip" link in this page (or just go back to [19]the main
   yarrow page) and you'll be presented with a list of servers. We want
   to read GROGGS, so click on the "groggs" link in the left-hand column.
   
   You're now looking at [20]the index of items on GROGGS-- well, the
   most recent of them: you can page back all the way to 1995, when
   GROGGS took its current form. Each item shows the date it was most
   recently added to (with the newer ones towards the top), the number
   ("#") of replies to that item, the name of the user who most recently
   added to it, and the subject. The items in bold, which will be all of
   them at present, are items which contain replies you haven't read;
   those in italics are full items, which will have been continued
   further up the index.
   
   Click any of the subject lines to read that item and all the replies.
   Each reply is preceded by a block giving the user's email address, and
   the date of posting, on the right. On the left is the user's grogname:
   a fanciful, possibly descriptive, piece of text which is associated
   with that particular user. If you were logged in as a regular user, at
   the bottom of the page there'd be [21]a box to add your own reply.
   
2.3. A glossary

   Spend a little time exploring GROGGS now. Here's some information to
   help you explore it.
   
   hup
          Most RGTP clients list the index with the items that have most
          recently been added to towards the top. Most groggers only read
          the top few items in the index. So if you feel an item deserves
          more discussion, you can append a reply saying "hup", which
          will bring it to the top of the index. You can theoretically
          hup any item (unless it's been continued), but doing so with
          items more than a few years old is considered odd.
          
   grogvote
          an annual contest to nominate groggers in various categories.
          (The categories are also nominated by the users, but "Star of
          GROGGS" and "Sage of GROGGS" are traditional.) The results are
          read out every year at the [22]GROGGS garden party, which
          happens during Cambridge May Week.
          
   [23]ucam.chat
          a newsgroup internal to Cambridge University. In recent years,
          it has taken a lot of the traffic (and traditions) which once
          were part of GROGGS.
          
   grogger; grogging
          a user of GROGGS; to use GROGGS
          
   GREED
          An important RGTP-reading program; it runs under Emacs. See
          [24]the GREED home page for more information.
          
   Infinity Questions (IQ)
          A very long-running game on GROGGS. One user picks a subject
          and the others have to ask "yes/no" questions to work out what
          it is. Rounds can sometimes last months. New players should be
          warned that the definition of "subject" is rather looser than
          in many similar games: the subjects of previous rounds have
          included: the autonomic nervous system; honesty; [25]PuTTY;
          cork (the substance); Cambridge, Massachusetts; the hosts and
          routers of the global Internet; Leo Blair; the London Eye; a
          backup tape for chiark.greenend.org.uk; and the White House's
          red encrypted telephone to the Kremlin.
          
   ITWSBT
          I think we should be told
          
   YA(x)AICMFP
          You are (x) and I claim my five pounds
          
   TIOSSUOTW(x)TIWPAO (and variants)
          [26]This is obviously some strange usage of the word (x) that I
          wasn't previously aware of
          
   SWITCH NOBOYDIE / SNB / DoeS aNyBody...
          [27]Chris Boyd (cb113) was a user of GROGGS who would always
          answer questions of the form "Does anyone know the way to
          Arbury?" with "Yes". To work around this, people began writing
          SWITCH NOBOYDIE before such questions, which soon became SNB.
          It's also often mixed into the question itself: "DoeS aNyBody
          know the way to Arbury?"
          
   spqr1
          any Cambridge person (since this is the general form of a
          Cambridge user id)
          
2.4. Finding out more

   If, now you've looked around, you'd like to participate in GROGGS, all
   you need to do is register for a GROGGS account. The link to do this
   is given on [28]the login page, but you can go there directly if you'd
   rather: [29]http://rgtp.thurman.org.uk/gossip/groggs/newbie. Once
   you've filled that in, you'll get email back explaining what to do
   next.
   
   If you find any problems, email the GROGGS editors; their address
   always appears in the [30]message of the day.
   
3. Getting started as an administrator

   (This section is a little more sketchy than I'd like. Any help would
   be appreciated.)
   
3.1. Installing yarrow

   There isn't (yet) any .deb or .rpm packaged version of yarrow, though
   it's on the drawing board. Instead, you'll need to [31]download the
   tarballs and install things yourself.
   
   You'll need a fairly recent version of [32]Python-- 2.1 should be good
   enough-- and (obviously) a working web server.
   
   You'll also need the Python Distutils installed. Many versions of
   Python have them installed already; I recommend, when you're following
   the instructions here, that you assume yours does until you find it
   doesn't. If yours turns out not to have them, you can find them in the
   Debian package [33]python2.1-dev (or [34]python2.2-dev, depending on
   the version of Python you're using; nothing's stopping you installing
   both). RPM users can [35]look on rpmfind. And everyone can get them
   from [36]the Python website.
   
   Unpack the tarball:
   
     tar xvzf yarrow-1.2.0.tar.gz
     
   and move into the directory it created:
   
     cd yarrow-1.2.0
     
   Now, as root, run
   
     make install
     
   If it all worked, then
   
     [37]http://localhost/cgi-bin/yarrow.cgi
     
   should be the address of a new and working RGTP server!
   
   Go ahead and test it by clicking on the entry for GROGGS in the menu,
   and then the "Yes, I'm just visiting" button. The page should take a
   good while to appear the first time, because yarrow has to download
   the whole index for the past seven years or so-- there's about half a
   megabyte. Fortunately, this only happens the first time you read from
   any server: after that, it's all cached.
   
   Some odds and ends:
     * If you don't have root access to the machine you're installing
       yarrow onto, you'll have to install things more or less yourself.
       You can tell yarrow where to find the files by modifying
       yarrow.conf; if you have to move yarrow.conf itself, simply change
       the definition of the variable "baseconf" in config.py.
     * You may also like to install some other RGTP clients; there are
       several listed on the [38]links page.
     * If you need any help, please do email me-- I need to know how this
       section can be improved.
     * Note that there is no gopher support in this version. I may add it
       back in if anyone asks for it.
       
3.2. Installing your own RGTP servers

   This is rather more difficult. There are, as far as I know, two RGTP
   server codebases in the world. One is the one [39]GROGGS runs on,
   which has never been officially released. The other is one I'm
   writing, called [40]spurge; it's been used effectively in the past,
   but it's in no way stable enough for a production environment. I hope
   that in the future it will be possible to use spurge to run a reliable
   RGTP server; in the meantime, you're welcome to download it and try it
   out. Offers of help and messages of encouragement are welcomed.
   
4. The future

   This project has largely met its original goals: I learned a good deal
   both about Python and about web applications, it was both challenging
   and fun to write, and it got a good number of people interested once
   more in GROGGS. It also sparked the imagination of others, bringing
   forth other projects in their own right (notably [41]Vendepacx). Now
   that all this is done, my hopes for its future are:
     * that it will serve as an accessible method of using GROGGS for a
       new generation of groggers
     * that it can be packaged into .deb and .rpm form, and, perhaps,
       become a package within the Debian project
     * that (combined with a stable server) it can become a viable option
       for people looking to run a small, fast and simple discussion
       system. In diversity is strength.
       
5. Credits

   [42]John Stark (jas11) created GROGGS. [43]Ian Jackson (iwj10) created
   RGTP. The interface of yarrow was largely modelled after
   [44]LiveJournal, which was created by [45]Brad Fitzpatrick. The
   following people, in alphabetical order, have given help, advice or
   moral support during the growth of yarrow: [46]Peter Colledge,
   [47]Natalie Currie, [48]Martin Hardcastle, [49]Michelle Hart, [50]Neil
   Roques, [51]Firinel Taranen, [52]Simon Tatham. Thanks to all of you.
   There are probably more people I've left out; if one of them's you,
   please do tell me.
