yarrow v0.30
------------

A full README will come in a later version. For now,
please mail any questions to thomas@thurman.org.uk .

What's still to come before we hit v1.0:
 * User account requests.
    (This is known to be broken in v0.1. You should use
     another client, such as WrenGROGGS or GREED, for
     this, or simply mail the server's editors and ask.)

 * Automatic highlighting of embedded URLs, email
    addresses and itemids.

 * Possibly some implementation of the editor commands.

Visit http://rgtp.thurman.org.uk/yarrow/ for the latest
news, and http://rgtp.thurman.org.uk/gossip/ to see Yarrow
in practice.
