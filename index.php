<P>Pinkstuff suffered a system attack early on Friday morning.  As a
result, some web pages, including this one, were lost.  Data will
be restored from backup as soon as possible; if you are a pinkstuff user
and wish to restore from your own backups before this, please do.</P>

<P>telnet is no longer running on this server.  Please use ssh if
possible - <a

good Windows ssh client.  If you are unable to use ssh, <a

can open telnet for certain hosts.</P>

<P>We recommend that all users log in as soon as possible and change

<P ALIGN=CENTER><SMALL>But I tell you: Love your enemies and
pray for those who persecute you,  that you may be sons of your Father
in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends
rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.  If you love those who love
you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing
that?  And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more
than others? Do not even pagans do that?  Be perfect, therefore, as
your heavenly Father is perfect.</SMALL></P>
