Changelog

v1.20
=====

1. If the browser supports it, the HTML that yarrow produces will be
compressed.

2. Fixed the config login bug: yarrow now no longer makes a connection
to the RGTP server when producing a configuration page. If, for example,
the server decided that the shared-secret was not the one yarrow knew
about, the connection attempt would fail. Since yarrow would then not
render the rest of the page, it was impossible to change the
shared-secret to the correct one.

3. A couple of enhancements for those running old or text-only browsers.
Unread articles in the index are prefixed with a degree sign, instead of
using the bold attribute to convey the information: some browsers don't
display this well, especially within a hyperlink. Replies to an item are
separated using a horizontal rule on non-CSS browsers: the solid bar of
the title line does this on browsers which support CSS.

4. The Content-Length header is set correctly, allowing the use of
persistent connections.

5. Introduced rudimentary caching support (ETags only, not yet using
Last-Modified).

6. The user can set an RGTP server's message of the day, if they have
the correct permissions.

7. The user can modify an RGTP server's user database, if they have the
correct permissions.

8. CSS is included in all HTML pages. Nowhere does yarrow now rely on static
content from the HTTP server.

9. Warnings that you need cookies added to the login pages. (Thanks to
cgb10 for this idea.)

10. Quite a bit of code tidying.

11. Installation script, based on distutils. No .rpm or .deb support yet.

v1.11
=====

1. Fixed a silly bug which stopped you being able to request a new account
on an RGTP server. A couple of variable names were being sent as literal
text.

2. Something that should have been in 1.10 but didn't make the cut: the
screen that tells you you must be logged in to read a server, and gives
you a button to do so, is sent with HTTP 200 OK, not HTTP 403 Forbidden.
This means that intermediate agents are less likely to stop the end user
seeing the content and so knowing how to fix it. It also means that such
a page can be, for example, set as the project's demonstration page on
Freshmeat.

v1.10
=====

1. A new "visitor" mode. Everyone who doesn't have a login cookie can get one
just by pressing a button, as well as by logging in. The visitor cookie isn't
good for much, but it gives you access to servers which allow guest login;
see the next point.

2. Automatic guest login has been reinstated if you're logged in at all, even
if it's only as a visitor (see previous point). This was removed by request
in v0.40, but I was far too draconian and removed it in _all_ cases, which
effectively stopped non-groggers from reading GROGGS at all. So you can now
browse as much as you like.

3. It's now much less important where you install yarrow. Only one path
is hard-wired (that of the configuration file) and that can be simply changed.
All other paths are given in the configuration.

4. Dates are now printed slightly more prettily: the "am/pm" is lowercase
and without a space. Also, rgtp IDs (email addresses) are printed in
monospace; I'm not sure I like this, but I'm experimenting with it.

5. URLs containing commas are properly linkified.

6. Fixed bug from v1.00: RGTP logs are printed only once. (They were being
printed twice, once after the closing </html> tag.)

7. The action of confirming the "catchup" option must be submitted by
HTTP PUT, so that it can't easily be faked by an external link.

v1.00
=====

Yep, we're finally here. Most of the changes were minor: v0.40 turned out to
have been the last big step, as the plan was.

Changes in this version:

1. Ability to page through the index, instead of being shown all the several
hundred entries on one page

2. Reformat option reinstated

3. Option to view the MOTD at the top of the index, or not, or only when it's
changed

4. Logging the RGTP session to screen reinstated

5. HTTP errors returned on error pages

6. Accepts server hostnames as well as nicknames in URLs (thanks to Peter
Colledge for the suggestion)

7. Manual written; website almost entirely rewritten too.

Happy grogging... 

v0.40
=====

This version has had more changes than any other version since the beginning.
Because of this, it's been a good long while since the release of 0.31, so I
thought a new release was about due once the code was fairly stable. Some
of the lesser-used features have been disabled or broken, though, and some of
the planned new features aren't yet working. I'm planning to move through
the v0.4x releases fairly quickly as I fix these problems.

This should, DV, be the last major release before v1.00.

Specific new features:

1. ALL STATE IS HELD ON THE SERVER. One password, which the user chooses, gets
them access to everything. In v0.31 and before, all state was held in the
browser, using cookies. This caused security problems (shared-secrets shouldn't
be sent across the net more than necessary, and certainly not on every pageview),
usability problems (the user must enter their shared-secret on every machine
they use, possibly more often than once if it's a public machine they can't
stay logged into) and feature problems (features that needed a lot of state,
such as (2) below, couldn't be implemented.)

2. yarrow remembers when the user last read an item, and prints the item's name
in bold if it's new or updated since then. (However, we may have to look for
another way of doing this: Lynx has trouble distinguishing bold and non-bold
hyperlinked text.)

3. Removed feature: earlier versions would attempt to log into servers as
"guest" if they couldn't get in any other way. This provides public access
to some servers (notably the Cambridge GROGGS system). However, people
were simultaneously concerned about privacy and the intrusion of robots,
and unwilling to remove the "guest" account for general access. So, in
response to requests, v0.40 no longer attempts to log in as "guest"; in
cases where it would have tried to do so before, it gives instructions
to the user to try logging in as "guest", so that humans can follow
instructions but robots will be foxed.

4. Major code refix. All possible commands are handled by separate classes.
(As part of this, note that there's no default page for a server any more: you
must explicitly say "/servername/browse" or whatever. Giving no command gets
you a list of commands. This removes feature 7 of v0.31 in the list below.)
Much cleaning up remains to be done.

5. The index is cached, so it doesn't have to transfer it from the rgtp
server every time you request the index. On GROGGS, particularly, this has
speeded things up a good deal, since the GROGGS index is about half a megabyte.
This should have been done a long time ago, but it needed getting around to.

6. You can specify a list of grognames and yarrow will pick one. (I'm not sure
how useful this is, but GREED does it, so I thought I'd add it here too.)

7. The message of the day is displayed at the top of the index.

What's broken:

1. Gopher support. If you need this, stay at v0.31. It'll be back before v1.00.

2. Literal RGTP. This will probably be removed soon, unless anyone tells me
that they actually use it. :)

3. The config options to reformat, and to hide the MOTD at the top of the
index, do nothing. This is acknowledged on the page beside their names.

v0.31
=====
1. All code split off into a separate package, "Yarrow". yarrow.cgi contains
only the barest code to call into this. This means things run faster, because
they get compiled.

2. The client nonce is random. (Stupidly, it was a fixed string before; that
was put in during testing and never removed.)

3. Option to view edit logs.

4. Option to send literal commands to the server.

5. itemids now have the TITLE attribute set in the HTML, as well as being
hyperlinked. This means that in most browsers, mousing an itemid will show
you the title of the item it refers to. Fake itemids are no longer made into
hyperlinks; their titles are set to the RGTP error message returned when
yarrow attempted to stat them.

6. Message in the server-choosing screen about downloading servers made
rather more sensible for people who don't happen to be running it on the
same host as the spurge distribution.

7. If we know your login name, the default page for a server is "browse",
not "login".

8. "log	in" rather than "log out" option appears on the "you have logged
out" screen. (Thanks to Peter Colledge for pointing this out.)

v0.30
=====
1. Better error handling: unavailable articles don't befuzzle yarrow; the same
problem also used to occur with continuations of now-dead items, and that's
fixed too. Last-ditch error handling improved; gives details of the error and
a stack trace, rather than an Apache crash screen.

2. Stupid oversight about importing a pointless and non-existent package called
"config" fixed.

3. Colour scheme simplified. (Image top right is now a .gif, ugh, but it works
on more browsers. Maybe I should forget about transparency, though.) Plus some
general rethinking of the UI.

4. You can use spaces in shared secrets, and they'll be ignored.

5. Hyperlinks with embedded itemids now work better (they don't cause HTML
errors, but they still slice up the URL oddly. Probably acceptable now, though).
A single @ is no longer assumed to be an email address.

6. Minutes are listed in the minutes column of the index, rather than months.
(aargh.)

7. Clicking on a "Continued from..." link takes you to the _end_ of that item,
sensibly.

8. The main script has been renamed from yarrow to yarrow.cgi, because some
people's servers were confused.

9. The logging feature uses <PRE> now, and so gives you a better idea of
what's going on (numbers of spaces are significant in many places in RGTP).

10. When you save your settings it goes back to the main screen.

11. You can specify the server directory in which static files (favicon.ico,
reverse-gossip.gif, yarrow.css) are kept separately, using the "static_prefix"
variable.

v0.20
=====

1. Adds hyperlinks to the text for http, gopher, ftp and mailto URLs, email
addresses and GROGGS itemids.

2. Fixed problem with constructors which meant that yarrow crashed when you
tried to create a new account on an RGTP server. Also cleaned up a lot of
other stuff to do with creating new accounts which you couldn't even get to
before, because of this.

3. The general can-happen-anywhere errors quote the text sent back from the
server to the client.

4. Picks up URL prefix from the webserver, rather than having to be told
explicitly.

5. Continued items have "-- continued above" in italics instead of the author's
name.

v0.10
=====

1. Can post. Does wordwrap. (Thanks to Simon Tatham for pointing me to the
algorithm used.)

2. Handles login names less than 16 characters properly (all you spqr1@cam
people can log in now).

3. Refactored code that picks up the name, grogname and date for each reply,
so that it works properly.

4. Option to reformat text added.

5. Lots of little layout changes.

6. Introduction of the gopher front end.

v0.02
=====
(initial release on Freshmeat)

1. RGTP library largely rewritten for consistence in use of callbacks, rather
than merely getting it to work.

2. "Continued from" and "continued to" links in items.

3. Quite a bit of code from yarrow itself moved out to the rgtp.py library.

v0.01
=====

First version.
